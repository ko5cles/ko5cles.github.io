        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            The application is hosted on my <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ko5cles/lyric_writer">Hugging-Face Space</a>.
            The jupyter notebooks used can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/ko5cles/lyric_writer">GitHub</a>.
            Please note that the code is under the MIT licence.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following sections, I'm going to explain what I have done, what problems I have met, and how I solved them.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The model uses the original transformer model described in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">"Attention Is All You Need"</a> paper
            and is trained using pop song lyrics gathered online.
        </p>

        <h1> Gathering Corpus </h1>
        <p>
            The notebook used to gather the corpus is named "Corpus.ipynb" in the GitHub repo,
            or you can open it in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VFN8rABWTGIPWoV0x8nCom4vzTcQ9M1y?usp=sharing">Google Colab</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you know, the Internet is a chaotic place. Web pages are not organized in a uniform way. What's worse, almost all lyrics are copyright protected,
            which means lyric provider APIs don't provide lyrics. These factors make web scraping difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, Wikipedia seems to be more structured.
            In order to gather song names by an artist, I download Wikipedia pages and use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">Beautiful Soup</a> to parse the page and search for specific elements.
            Then I use <a href="https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/">LyricsGenius</a> to get lyrics for each song.
            In order to use it, a <a href="https://genius.com/api-clients">Genius API access token</a> is needed.
            The reason that I did these steps separately is that the http connection provided by Genius is very limited in time.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, a lot of weird things are embedded in these lyrics—for example, the following line. We need to get rid of them.
        </p>
        <div class="text">
            "See Taylor Swift Live.Get tickets as low as $112.You might also like"
        </div>
        <p>
            After doing that, the total <a href="https://github.com/ko5cles/lyric_writer/blob/main/clean_lyrics_without_parenthese.txt">training file</a> size is  2.1 MB, which consists of 969 pop songs.
        </p>
        <p>
            How to prepare these data into training sets is the first major problem. Since I use the transformer architecture, the dataset should be prepared as inputs, teacher forcing, and target outputs.
            So initially, I pair every two subsequent sentences, add "sol" to the start of the first sentence as the input, add "sol" to the start of the second sentence as teacher forcing,
            and add "eol" to the end of the second sentence as the desired output. I used the set to train a simpler model with only 4 layers on each side.
            The model's training accuracy turned out to be consistently low, which could mean two things: the learning rate is too large so that the model is not learning anything,
            or the model architecture is too simple to capture the complexity. After I adjusted the learning rate to 1e-5, the training accuracy was still low.
            So, the reason is probably that the lyrics are too complicated to be modeled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, I took a look at the lyrics and found some possible reasons:
        </p>
        <div class="lyric">
            [Verse 1]<br>
            Why do you look so good in those jeans?<br>
            Why'd you come around me with an ass like that?<br>
            You're makin' all my thoughts obscene<br>
            This is not, not like me<br>
            Why you keep on texting me like that? (Damn)<br>
            Got other things I need my mind on, yeah<br>
            Other responsibilities<br>
            This is not, not like me<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that<br>
            Do that to me?<br>
            Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that<br>
            Do that to me?<br>
            Why did you do that, do that, do that, do that<br>
            Do that to me?<br>
            Why did you do that?<br>
            Why did you do that?<br>
        </div>
        <p>
            The above lyrics are from <em>"Why did you do that"</em> by Lady Gaga. In a pop song, each section is structured very differently.
            In verses, the lyrics are more diverse. On the contrary, in choruses, the lyrics are often repeated.
            Since they are approximately proportioned in a song, and I didn't provide this information to the transformer,
            the transformer may be confused about when to repeat and when to write new lines.
            Therefore, only the first appearance is preserved if a lyric repeats itself several times during cleaning.
        </p>
        <div class="lyric">
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            But I keep cruisin'<br>
            Can't stop, won't stop groovin'<br>
            It's like I got this music in my mind<br>
            Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"<br>
        </div>
        <p>
            The above lyrics are from <em>"Shake it off"</em> by Taylor Swift.
            We can see the logic relevance between line1 and line2, and that between line3 and line4 are strong.
            But the relevance between line2 and line3 is weak. Therefore, it is inappropriate for me to group line2 and line3 together for training.
            This is not always the case, though: sometimes, line1,2&3 are logically grouped together.
            But for simplicity reasons, I only use pairs of distinct lyrics in my training.
        </p>
        <div class="lyric">
            [Chorus]<br>
            Like the girls you loved before (Ooh)<br>
            Made you the one I've fallen for<br>
            Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)<br>
            Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for<br>
            All of the girls you loved before<br>
            But I love you more<br>
        </div>
        <p>
            The above lyrics are from <em>"All Of The Girls You Loved Before"</em> by Taylor Swift.
            In pop songs, there are often harmony words in parentheses.
            In this implementation, I simply use a text vectorization layer, which will remove all punctuations, to tokenize the lyrics.
            Without this context, the transformer may be confused about English grammar.
            So, as an easy solution, I removed content inside parentheses altogether.
        </p>

        <h1>Training the Model</h1>
        <p>
            The notebook used for training the model is named "lyric_writer.ipynb" in the GitHub repo, or you can open it in <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WpyUukactau7ngvH7YINH_DGXtIeMA04?usp=sharing"> Google Colab</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, this implementation uses the original transformer architecture.
            It composes of 12 stacked encoder layers and decoder layers. The embedding size for each word is 256; the first layer size of the feed forward network is 512;
            the number of heads used in multi-head attention layer is 8; a dropout rate of 0.1 is also applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major problem with training this model is coming up with the hyperparameters for the model to gradually converge.
            I started with 4 stacked layers as with neural machine translation and 128 embedding size and gradually increased it to the current size.
            The other issue is the learning rate. There were various cases where it looked like the model was going to converge but suddenly diverged.
            Clearly, the learning rate with probably too small for the initial steps and too large for the ending steps.
        </p>
        <div class="figure">
            <img src="figures/learning_rate_plot.png" alt="learning rate comparison"><br>
            fig1. Learning rate comparison between the original paper and the implemented one.
        </div>
        <p>
            The adjusted learning rate is showed in the above figure. The gradients from training are probably less stable in their directions.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also want to show you some interesting moments while training the model.
            These are the results generated by the model at different accuracy rates.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the accuracy rate is about 20%:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> Been a [UNK] [UNK] im a [UNK]
        </div>
        <p>
            When the accuracy rate is about 35%:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> im talking fear fear that im talking
        </div>
        <p>
            When the accuracy rate is about 57% (this is my personal favorite):
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> been gettin gettin gettin high now
        </div>
        <p>
            When the accuracy rate is about 75%:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> dont make moves like im gonna dance
        </div>
        <p>
            When the accuracy rate is about 85% (starts to memorize):
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> been saying yes instead of no
        </div>
        <p>
            And eventually about 90%:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            print(Punchline("I'm doing good I'm on some new shit"))<br>
            >>> been saying yes instead of no
        </div>
        <p>
            I also tried a lot of other inputs and got a lot of interesting generated lines. Eventually, I used the model with 85% accuracy.
            I'll save some fun if you want to <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ko5cles/lyric_writer">try it here</a>.
            I had no expectations before doing this, and I have to say I'm surprised by the generated content,
            especially when the training file is so small. I'm also motivated by this, and I'll share what I'm doing now in the section below.
        </p>

        <h1>Future Improvements</h1>
        <h2> Unsupervised Pretraining</h2>
        <p>
            The model has no prior knowledge about the English language. The labeled training file used is only 2.1 MB,
            so it will be hard for the model to learn about the language.
            In addition, compared to everyday speaking and writing, lyrics (at least some of them) are more abstract (metaphors, etc.).
            So, it will be even harder for the model to perform well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm working on the pretraining technique used in the <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf">GPT paper</a>,
            and I'm trying to determine which language modeling task is ideal for this application.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Tokenization by Semantic Aggregation
        </h2>
        <p>
            The tokenization technique used in this implementation is very fundamental.
            For example, "gettin'" and "getting" are mapped to different tokens. These abbreviations can be solved by hand-coding abbreviation rules.
            However, "automobile" and "car" are also mapped to different tokens.
            It is intuitive that if similar things are tokenized the same or similar, the attention mechanism will transform these words into embeddings more easily.
            I tried prefix, root word, and suffix methods as in the Bert architecture. But I think English is somehow phonetic,
            so similar concepts such as "apple" and "pears" look very different from each other. On the other hand, Chinese is less (or not at all) phonetic.
            Apples("苹果") and pears("梨子") look kind of similar (they both have the "木" part, and "艹" is related to "木").
            I happen to be a native Chinese speaker, so I'm thinking about doing semantic aggregation with Chinese and converting them to English.

        <h1> Postscript</h1>
        <p>
            If you have read toward the end of this, I want you to know that I'm really intrigued by artificial intelligence and want to start a career with it.
            Also, I'm very intelligent(an outlier, if I'm being honest 😂) and capable of self-learning.
